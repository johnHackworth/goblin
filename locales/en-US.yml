  title: "How to use Firefish"
  step1_1: "Welcome!"
  step1_2: "Let's get you set up. You'll be up and running in no time!"
  step2_1: "First, please fill out your profile."
  step2_2: "Providing some information about who you are will make it easier for others
    to tell if they want to see your posts or follow you."
  step3_1: "Now it's time to follow some people!"
  step3_2: "Your home and social timelines are based off of who you follow, so try
    following a couple accounts to get started.\nClick the plus circle on the top
    right of a profile to follow them."
  step4_1: "Let's get you out there."
  step4_2: "For your first post, some people like to make an {introduction} post or
    a simple \"Hello world!\""
  step5_1: "Timelines, timelines everywhere!"
  step5_2: "Your server has {timelines} different timelines enabled."
  step5_3: "The Home {icon} timeline is where you can see posts from the accounts
    you follow."
  step5_4: "The Local {icon} timeline is where you can see posts from everyone else
    on this server."
  step5_5: "The Social {icon} timeline is a combination of the Home and Local timelines."
  step5_6: "The Recommended {icon} timeline is where you can see posts from servers\
    \ the admins recommend."
  step5_7: "The Global {icon} timeline is where you can see posts from every other\
    \ connected server."
  step6_1: "So, what is this place?"
  step6_2: "Well, you didn't just join Firefish. You joined a portal to the Fediverse,
    an interconnected network of thousands of servers."
  step6_3: "Each server works in different ways, and not all servers run Firefish.
    This one does though! It's a bit complicated, but you'll get the hang of it in
    no time."
  step6_4: "Now go, explore, and have fun!"
